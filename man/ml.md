#### What Is Statistical Learning?

* `ad` data set of `sales` of a product in 200 markets with ad budgets for 3 media: TV, radio, and newspaper.
  * more generally, `Y = f(X)` + e where f is some fixed, but unknown fuction; e is a random error term w/ mean zero.
* `income` data set of 30 individuals suggests one might predict `income` using `years of education` and `seniority`.
* In essence, statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f and tools for evaluating estimates.

##### Why Estimate f?

* Prediction: Y<sup>^</sup> = f<sup>^</sup>(X) where they represent our estimate of f and resulting prediction for Y.
  * to minimize `reducible error`, while `irreducible error` proposes an upper bound on the prediction accuracy for Y.
* Inference:
