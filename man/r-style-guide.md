Good style is important because while your code only has one author, it will usually have multiple readers, and when you know you will be working with multiple people on the same code, itâ€™s a good idea to agree on a common style up-front.

#### Notation and naming

##### File names

File names should end in .r and be meaningful.

    # Good
    explore-diamonds.r
    hadley-wickham-hw-1.r
    # Bad
    foo.r
    my-homework.R
